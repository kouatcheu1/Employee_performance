## Analysis ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ˆ

o **Employee Performance Analysis was performed using sql, and the following were derived**:
- Identify if higher compensation correlates with more senior roles.
Outcome: From the insight Executive has highest average salary followed by senior level while entry level staff has lowest average salary. 
From the result, higher compensation correlates with more senior roles.
- Work Setting Analysis: Compare performance trends across different work settings (Hybrid, In-person, Remote).
Insights: Understand how experience level impacts average salaries.
Outcome: From the result, staff that works in-person has highest average salary while staffs that works hybrid has lowest average salary.
- Evaluate which job roles and experience levels tend to have better salaries.
Insights: Identify high-paying job roles and the experience levels they require.
<p align="justify">Outcome: From the result Machine Learning and Ai is the job role with highest average salary at executive experience level while Data Quality and Operation has the lowest average salary in job role at entry level experience level. This implies that staff with Executive experience level tends to have highest salary while staff with entry level tends to have lower salary.</p> 

*You can access the SQL scripts file* [here](https://github.com/kouatcheu1/Employee_performance/blob/main/EMPLOYEE_ANALYSIS_SQL.sql)

o **Productivity and Engagement Insights Using Python was performed, and the following were derived**:
- Determine whether senior employees are more productive (using salary as a proxy).
*<p align="justify">Outcome*: From the result, senior level has highest count of staff while executive has lowest staff. Staffs with executive experience level has highest average salary while staff with entry level has lowest average salary. This tends that staffs with Executive experience level are more productive using salary as a proxy while staffs with entry level has lower productivity in the company using salary as proxy.</p>
- Engagement Across Job Categories
*<p align="justify">Outcome*: From the result, Machine Learning and AI is the job category with the highest salary while Data Quality and Operations has lowest salary. Data Engineering has the highest employee count while Cloud and Database has lowest employee count.</p> 
- Geographical Influence on Productivity
*<p align="justify">Outcome*: From the results, employee average salary and regions shows that employee who lives in QATAR has the highest average salary while employees that lives in INDONESIA receives the lowest salary.</>
- Tenure and Engagement Trends
*<p align="justify">Outcome*: A new column was added to calculate the tenure by subtracting the current year from employeeâ€™s work year. The new column was use to group the average salary to get if longer tenure correlates with higher salary. From the result, employeeâ€™s with the higher tenure tends to have lower salary while employeeâ€™s with lower tenure had highest average salary.</p>

o **Preprocessing Data for Attrition Modeling using different python libraries was performed, and the following were derived**:
The confusion matrix shows the model's performance:
- Matrix Interpretation:
o	True Positives (2807): The model accurately predicted attrition for all employees.
o	No False Positives or Negatives were detected, indicating perfect accuracy.
- Model Performance:
o	Accuracy: 100%
o	Precision, Recall, and F1-score: All scores are 1.00, demonstrating excellent predictive capability. However, the absence of other classes (like attrition cases) indicates potential class imbalance issues.
